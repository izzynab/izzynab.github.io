## Crash Engine

Hello. This is my personal game engine Project.I have been working on this project since august 2020.It took me about
8 months to get the project to the current state.Crash Engine is written in C++ using OpenGL libraries.
You cannot really use it to make any game so better name for it would be probably Graphics Engine?


##### The main features:
- pbr pipeline
- cubemaps
- deffered rendering
- FXAA
- Bloom
- Directional Light
- SSAO
- Manipulation Gizmo
- Scene Serialization

Crash Engine is highly based on on the first episodes of The Cherno's Hazel Engine series. 
Due to desire to make this projects really working i just recreated a lot of features that the cherno
showed in his videos, like the logger and the core.
