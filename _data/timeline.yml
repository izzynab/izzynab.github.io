  description: I decided to became a software engineer and started learning c++.
                 After a while, I started learning UE 4. Then I learned about OpenGL and all sorts of 
                 rendering techniques and created my own little game engine project.
                Later on, I started learning Unity. I made my first lame mobile game and learned a lot about shaders and
                and workflow in general In the meantime I learned how to use Blender, and to satisfy my curiosity I also tried to 
                learn a bit of houdini and Davinci Resolve.
                
                I am currently creating my second mobile game. I am also planning to sell the shaders developed for the sake of this game
                on the unity asset store.
