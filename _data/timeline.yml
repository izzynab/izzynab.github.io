  description: I decided to became a software engineer and started learning c++.
                 After a while, I started learning UE 4. Then I learned about OpenGL and all sorts of 
                 rendering techniques and created my own little game engine project.
                Later on, I started learning Unity. I made my first lame mobile game and learned a lot about shaders and
                and workflow in general In the meantime I learned how to use Blender, and to satisfy my curiosity I also tried to 
                learn a bit of houdini and Davinci Resolve. I've learned basics of Gimp, Krita, Substance Painter and Substance Designer.
                Now I'm expanding my knowledge of shaders, rendering techniques and VFX, while creating Unity assets.
