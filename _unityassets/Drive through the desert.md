## Drive through the desert

This is my mobile game i developed and published while learning unity game engine. The game is bad optimized 
and you can't really play it on an old phone. The main reason for this is the procedural generation of the world.
Although the world is genreated using multiple threads, it still couses fps drops every few seconds no really low end devices.
But if do not have old phone the game would be just fine.


##### The main features:
- Procedural generation of the:
	1. Map
	2. Road
	3. Foliage
	4. Rocks and buildings
- Money and shopping system
- Basic UI
- Multiple cars that can be upgraded
